## 📌 Project Overview

The **Food Item Price Comparison** project is a **Java console-based application** developed using **core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The main goal of this project is to compare prices of different food items and determine which item is cheaper or more expensive in a simple and structured way.

This project closely follows the **standard Eclipse Java project structure**, as visible in the screenshot. It is designed especially for **beginners and students**, helping them understand how multiple Java classes interact with each other in a real-world scenario.

### 🎯 Real-Life Context

In real life, applications like **Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats**, and supermarket billing systems continuously compare prices of food items to display the best offers to customers. This project simulates a **basic version of such price comparison logic**, implemented using Java classes.

## 📁 Folder Explanation

1. **src/Item_Price**

   * Contains all Java source (`.java`) files.
   * This is where the program logic is written.

2. **bin/Item_Price**

   * Contains compiled `.class` files generated by the Java compiler.
   * These files are executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

3. **.classpath & .project**

   * Eclipse IDE configuration files.
   * Help Eclipse manage build paths and project metadata.

4. **.settings**

   * Stores IDE-specific project settings.

👉 This folder layout is widely used in **real-world Java applications** developed using Eclipse IDE.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

### 1️⃣ Class and Object

* `FoodItem` is a **class** that acts as a blueprint for food items.
* Objects represent real food products with prices.

**Real-Life Example:**
Every food item listed in a restaurant menu is an object created from a food item template.

---

### 2️⃣ Encapsulation

* Food item data (name, price) is stored inside a class.
* Access to data is controlled using methods.

**Real-Life Example:**
In online shopping apps, product prices are fetched using secure methods instead of direct access.

---

### 3️⃣ Separation of Logic

* `FoodItem.java` handles food-related data.
* `Price_Comparison.java` handles comparison logic and execution.

**Real-Life Example:**
In e-commerce systems, product data and pricing logic are managed in separate modules for clarity and maintenance.

---

## 📝 Class Description

### 🔹 FoodItem.java

**Purpose:**

* Represents a food item entity.

**Responsibilities:**

* Store food item name
* Store food item price
* Provide access to food details

**Industry Mapping:**
Acts as a **POJO (Plain Old Java Object)** similar to product models used in retail applications.

---

### 🔹 Price_Comparison.java

**Purpose:**

* Acts as the main class and comparison logic handler.

**Responsibilities:**

* Create food item objects
* Compare prices
* Display the cheaper or costlier item

**Industry Mapping:**
Works like a **business logic layer**, similar to price engines used in online marketplaces.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✔️ Simple and clean Java code
* ✔️ Easy price comparison logic
* ✔️ Beginner-friendly project
* ✔️ Console-based output
* ✔️ Eclipse-compatible structure

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open **Eclipse IDE**
3. Import the project as **Existing Java Project**
4. Navigate to:

   ```text
   src → Item_Price → Price_Comparison.java
   ```
5. Right-click → **Run As → Java Application**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. Compare more than two food items
2. Take user input using `Scanner`
3. Add discount and tax calculation
4. Store items in collections (ArrayList)
5. Create GUI using JavaFX or Swing

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

* Understanding Java project folder structure
* Clear knowledge of classes and objects
* Basic implementation of comparison logic
* Practical exposure to Eclipse IDE
